To keep this simpler and easy to read, let's standardize on Behavior Drive Development's way of writing use cases. (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development#Principles_of_BDD )

Story 1:
In order to draw a map
As a worldbuilder
I want to place towns and geographic features on a map.

Scenario 1:
Given the user wants to create a map
When they have the shape of a continent in mind
Then are presented with a blank map and continent drawing tool.

Scenario 2:
Given the user wants to create a map
when they have a set of cities/towns to place on the map
Then they are presented with the open map and given a tool for placing those towns/cities.

Scenario 3:
Given the user wants to create a map
when they have a geographic feature to add such as a forest
then they are presented with the open map and given a geography placement tool.

Scenario 4:
Given the user wants to create a mpa
when they want to change the type of the geographic feature to be placed by the geographic placement tool
then there is a way to select a different type of geographic feature to place.
